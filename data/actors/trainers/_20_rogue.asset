  dialogues:
  - In darkness some weapons deal more damage, especially for those Landers that
    go rogue and deceive.
  - Traps are dangerous for the ones that have a path of Guile, being able to finish
    those in suddenly.
  - One strike carefully landed is fatal for enemies, as a swift dagger in the back
    is hard to block.
