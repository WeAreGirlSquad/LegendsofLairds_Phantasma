  - You look like you have a good pair of hands, Lander. Have you tried making camp
    yet? Yes, I mean fire!
  - To make camp press    <voffset=0.3em> <sprite="KeySample" index=10><voffset=0em>
  - and select the fireplace. Because you have good eyes, you'll see where you can
    make camp.
  - Did you know when you take a rest at a fireplace, you will heal?
