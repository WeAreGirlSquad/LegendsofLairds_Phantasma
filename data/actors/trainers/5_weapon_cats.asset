  dialogues:
  - Already learned about your inventory, weapon ring and how to equip, Lander? I
    hope so!
  - There are seven categories of weapons you can use. Swords and axes are great
    to strike in combat.
  - However, mid range weapons help you out of clashes. Staffs and spears help you
    defend better.
  - But do not underestimate the use of daggers, hammers and bows! These weapons
    are special!
  - I am sure you can find any of these on this island - and helpful items for your
    survival.
