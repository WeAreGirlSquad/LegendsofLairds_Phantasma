  dialogues:
  - As you meet other tribes, Lander, be wise to build on your bonds. Every bond
    will grow your name and
  - as a true Lander, in fellowship alone you can become a Laird. Before you claim
    an island, be sure
  - you are known as a leader or at least a formidable opponent for those who seek
    to plunder.
