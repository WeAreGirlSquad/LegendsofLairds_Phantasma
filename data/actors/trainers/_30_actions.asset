  dialogues:
  - Did you know that you can confirm, cancel and sheath? Of course you did! You
    are a smart one, Lander.
  - Can you teach me how? So to cancel I just press     <voffset=0.3em> <sprite="KeySample"
    index=20><voffset=0em>
  - You are saying that this is how I cancel raising my Pha? Or go back in a menu,
    like in battle?
  - And Action? Ah, it makes sense to press     <voffset=0.3em> <sprite="KeySample"
    index=19><voffset=0em>
  - So you are telling that when I sheath my weapon, I would be fighting with bare
    hands? But how?
  - It makes so much sense to press     <voffset=0.3em> <sprite="KeySample" index=13><voffset=0em>
  - "to sheath. Thank you, I feel much more at ease now.\r"
