  dialogues:
  - You better equip something, Lander. Just running around will get you nowhere.
    Instead, harvest!
  - 'Use an Axe to cut a tree, a Hammer to mine rock, a Spear or Bow to hunt for
    wild. '
  - What, you are surprised that you can do more with your weapons than just fight?
    This is not a game!
  - Daggers, you say? Its too long a story. What do you mean with swords, THOSE are
    for fighting!
  - All right, enough of these silly.. no, you do not need a weapon to collect leaf.
    Just your hands.
