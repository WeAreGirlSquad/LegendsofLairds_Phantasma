  - To reach places higher up, the best way is to do this by jumping. Jumping is
    not that hard at all!
  - 'Press         <voffset=0.3em> <sprite="KeySample" index=37><voffset=0em>to jump. '
  - Try jumping and running to reach higher and cover more distance. Be careful though!
  - Even though the gravity here is lesser than our home planet, you'll still fall
    and might get hurt.
