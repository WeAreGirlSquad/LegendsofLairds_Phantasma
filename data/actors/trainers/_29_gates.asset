  dialogues:
  - The Warpers? Well, I don't know exactly how they work, but what they do is that
    they activate if a
  - truth stone is in its dark pillar and somehow interacts with your Pha. Once you
    you step through
  - it feels like all the time and the world bends into a single point, like some
    sort of tunnel.
  - 'Once you go through it, you come out strangely enough at the other end - high
    in the sky. '
  - Good thing the gravity isn't the same as our home, else we would be crushed when
    hitting the ground!
