  dialogues:
  - Why we are wearing this cloth? What do you mean you do not know? Were you from
    the last wave?
  - Well, the gates are only for the priests of the Trivitium. They performed a ritual

  - Ah, you don't remember much. Don't worry, it will come back in time. For some
    longer than others.
