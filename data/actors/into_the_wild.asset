  dialogues:
  - You made it quite far, Lander. Must have been quite the trip. But are you ready
    for what lays ahead?
  - You see, Lander, it won't be an easy journey. It will not be a light task you
    have ahead of you.
  - 'We once were a proud people. But our enemies were too powerful and we had little
    time left. '
  - When the first ones went through the gate, they fell straight into The Great
    Wild. And most perished.
  - Some brave Landers found this remote island that still allows us even without
    a gate to get near.
  - However, traveling by gate is faster and easy. Not many landers have found a
    gate back to here...
  - Remember Lander, that The Great Wild is dangerous. Prepare yourself as much as
    you can. How?
  - Well, learn as much as possible from your fellow Landers! Find weapons to protect
    yourself!
  - And at least have sword. You do HAVE a sword, right, Lander? It is dangerous
    to go alone.
  - Once you are in the wild, find a holy pillar of one of the deities. It will be
    a hard task, Lander.
  - Avoid strong creatures, because you have only one life. Be careful, Lander.
